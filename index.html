			<img src="AlokVM.jpg" style="padding:1px;border:thin solid black;" alt="A horizontal photo taken on film with flash. The photo’s tones are dark and cool with a bluish tint. Four people sit at a table caught mid-laughter, two with their heads tilted back. The background is mostly dark, except where small lights are strung. A pearl white curtain covers the left 1/5th of the background. The people, from left to right, are wearing a pink blouse, a low-cut knit V shirt, a black shirt, and a black tank top. Probably taken somewhere in Brooklyn." style="width:560px;">

			<p>Image 1: Sitting at a table, laughing, from left to right: poet Alok Vaid-Menon, singer Sam Smith, stylist Donté McGuin, and designer Jeffrey Williams. I’ve followed Alok since they were a part of poetry duo Dark Matter, but they’ve since separated and Alok has pursued their own artistic/poetic/aesthetic work in New York. Sam Smith is a common singer-songwriter who recently came out as nonbinary. I was unfamiliar with Donté (@donte_mcguine) and Jeffrey (@jeffhova), but they are both pretty cool designers. It seems like a pretty tight-knit community as Alok is good friends with other trans fashionistas in NYC like Aaron Philip and Chella Man.</p>

			<img src="Aaron Philip.jpg" style="padding:1px;border:thin solid black;" alt="A horizontal image taken with a professional camera with a bright off-white background. In the top right corner reads 'Gay Times 500.'In the center, a young dark-skinned Black woman sits in a glossy black Invacare Contour U wheelchair. She is wearing a yellow dress with a black floral pattern, and a yellow feather boa is wrapped around her neck. Her head is slightly tilted to her right and she extends her left hand bent at the wrist, exuding confidence. She wears a light blonde shoulder-length wig with curved bangs and has purple pink eyeshadow, a thick mascara, and dark pink lipstick on." style="width:560px;">

			<p>Image 2: Transgender model Aaron Philip (IG @aaron___philip) poses for Gay Times’ 500th issue, celebrating the ‘the fluidity and connectivity of the people.’ I’ve been following her for about a year as I’ve found more queer & trans New Yorkers that are in the fashion industry.</p>

			<img src="indya.jpg" style="padding:1px;border:thin solid black;" alt="The image is grainy and probably taken on a self-timer on their phone. It shows a curly-haired person in a bathtub reading a book that reads ASSATA in red letters. There are other papers on the ledge of the background & the surrounding tiles are a dark tan. The bathtub is 2/3rds full and is a dull grey. A towel hangs in the top-left corner." style="width:560px;">

			<p>Image 3: Indrya Moore reads Assata: an autobiography by former Black Liberation Army member Assata Shakur in a bathtub. In the popular conscience, they’re most known for their role in Pose, an FX show from Ryan Murphy about ballroom culture that includes the largest trans cast ever. I know them as an active member of the NY community; they’re always showing up to actions and using their platform in positive ways, not just as a prominent trans person.</p>

			<img src="Moncho.jpg" style="padding:1px;border:thin solid black;"alt="A grainy but warm photo I took on my phone of a long-haired person in a striped shirt and black shorts who stands on a stage. The stage is lit by two ceiling lights above them. Behind them are a green couch and a light brown wooden bookshelf with many books that spans the length of the wall. There are at least four audience members facing the person intently, on the left-side sitting in individual chairs and on the right, on an orange couch that is as stiff to sit on as it looks. The person is holding a phone with two hands and are staring intently at it, mouth slightly ajar, and appear to be mid-sentence." style="width:560px;">

			<p>Image 4: My new friend Moncho Alvarado, a Poets' House 2018 Emerging Poets Fellow, performs a piece at the Asian American Writers’ Workshop in New York City. They identify as a Latinx-queer-poet, translator, visual artist, and educator & their work about diasporic identity moved me dearly.</p>

			<iframe  alt="A series of audio clips is paired with an image. The first audio clip describes the image. A small vial sits against a grey background. On a white label with a barcode, it reads: ‘Testosterone Cypionate injection USP. 1000 mg/10mL For intramuscular use only. 10 mL multi-dose vial.’ The subsequent audio clips are: ‘I am two minutes on testosterone.’ ‘This is my voice two weeks on testosterone.’ ‘And this is my voice two months on testosterone.’ ‘This is my voice two years on testosterone.’"style="padding:1px;border:thin solid black;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zFeh-DHUHs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

			<p>Image 5: My voice comparison at 2 seconds, 2 weeks, 2 months, and 2 years of being on testosterone. I started making Youtube videos right around the time I started testosterone to document my medical and social transition. I recorded the last clip explicitly for this project though, because I stopped making videos at some point. I’ve definitely gotten feedback from folks that the content was helpful and I was very intentional about what I talked about and how I presented it, but at some point it got paralytic to think about how content I did produce/include also was a statement of everything it included. I guess that’s something I can learn from other people at TNS that identify more as being ~creators~.</p>
